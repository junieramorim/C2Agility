# Guide to C2Drones Software

## Introduction
 
Need to talk about:
  - C2 concepts
  - Importance of Agility
  - What we expect from the software.

## Get Started

Before doing anything with C2Drones simulatation, it's necessary to have
downloaded and installed the [https://www.eclipse.org/](Eclipse IDE) and
[https://repast.github.io/](Repast Simphony) in the machine.
It's also necessary to have a copy of the project repository in the computer, so
it can be latter added as a Repast Simphony project in the Eclipse IDE.

The first thing needed to do is to turn on the Repast Simphony Perspective
in the Eclipse IDE that comes with Repast Simphony, which adds various menus,
toolbar buttons and so forth to Eclipse to make it easier to develop certain
kinds of projects.
To turn on the Repast Simphony perspective, click on the "Window" menu, then
"Open Perspective", "Other".
Choose the "Repast Simphony" perspective from the dialog that pops up and click
"OK".
Repast Simphony perspective should be selected in the upper right hand corner of
Eclipse.
Eclipse users only have to select the perspective from the dialog once because,
when Repast Simphony is restarted the last perspective will be used and the last
few will be available in the upper right hand corner.

With the perspective enabled, we just need to import the project right clicking
in "File" menu then in "Import Repast Examples".
We need to select the option "Select root directory" and find the path of the
C2Drones repository in the path where it is copied.
Lastly, select "C2Drones" in "Projects" box and right click "Finish".

To lauch C2Drones model it's needed to click on the small downward facing
triangle next to the Eclipse launcher button, where various available launchers
are seen, and right click on “C2Drones Model”.
