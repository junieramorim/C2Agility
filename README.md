# C2 Agility

The aiming of this repository is to provide all material used to execute the empirical evaluation of the C2 Agility in a software-based environment using the proposed model based in Channel Systems.

## Repository Organization

- [Workspace](https://github.com/junieramorim/C2Agility/tree/main/source) - In this directory, we present the complete version of the used workspace adopted in the simulation;
- [R's Scripts](https://github.com/junieramorim/C2Agility/tree/main/R) - In this directory, all scripts written in R used to generate the presented graphs in the paper are available;
- [Diagrams](https://github.com/junieramorim/C2Agility/tree/main/diagrams) - In this directory, all models representations based on the implementation are available;
- [Results](https://github.com/junieramorim/C2Agility/tree/main/results) - In this directory, we present all the obtained results described in the paperwork;
- [Repast](https://github.com/junieramorim/C2Agility/tree/main/tools/Eclipse%2BRepast) - In this directory, we provide _Repast_ related tools, due to problems following the original instruction material ([Documentation](https://repast.github.io/)) to a different range of plataforms, such as Mac and Linux;
- [Videos](https://github.com/junieramorim/C2Agility/videos) - Videos showing a batch running file and one single execution, both using RePast interface.
